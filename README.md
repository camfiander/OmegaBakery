# OmegaBakery
OmegaBakery is a console application which acts as the front for a store where customers view and buy products from. 
At the initial stages, the application is programmed to work for a fictional Bakery business, which sells baked goods made in-house as well as items manufactured by other companies.
It is designed in such a way that it can be easily extended to other businesses with minimal code changes.

The application aims to provide basic functionalities like view items available, add to order, apply discounts, and checkout order.
